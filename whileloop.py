''' While loops are used  to check a condition if condition is true it will repeatedly executing the loop
It will stop only if the condition become false
For loop will have finite loop iteration but in while loop iteration is depend on condition
If the condition is true in while loop then it will go inside loop and continuosly executing the loop until condition becomes false'''
